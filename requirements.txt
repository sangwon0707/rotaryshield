# Security note: All versions are pinned to major.minor to prevent
# automatic updates that could introduce vulnerabilities or breaking changes.
# Review and update these versions regularly through security audits.

# Platform-specific dependencies
# Linux distributions may have these packages available through system package managers:
# - Debian/Ubuntu: python3-yaml python3-psutil python3-watchdog
# - RHEL/CentOS: python3-PyYAML python3-psutil python3-watchdog
# - Alpine: py3-yaml py3-psutil py3-watchdog

# For production deployment, consider using:
# pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt
# to prevent dependency resolution conflicts
