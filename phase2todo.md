## 📝 Notes & Decisions

- **Architecture**: Maintain 3-layer security approach (Detection → Throttling → Blocking)
- **Compatibility**: Support Python 3.8+ for maximum compatibility
- **Dependencies**: Keep minimal for security and maintenance
- **Performance**: Target <50MB memory, <2% CPU usage, <100ms response time
