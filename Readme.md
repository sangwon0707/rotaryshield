## 🚀 What Makes RotaryShield Different?

**Inspired by industrial engineering principles**, RotaryShield introduces **progressive security response**:

1. 🔍 **Detection Layer** - Intelligent pattern recognition and threat scoring
2. ⏱️ **Throttling Layer** - Graduated response to minimize disruption
3. 🚫 **Blocking Layer** - Surgical precision when action is required

**Philosophy**: _Smart escalation prevents both attacks and false positives_

---

## 💡 Engineering Innovation

### The Rotary Pump Principle Applied to Cybersecurity

Drawing from **power engineering experience**, RotaryShield applies **positive displacement theory**:

- **Controlled Pressure**: Gradual increase in security measures
- **Efficient Operation**: Minimal resource waste, maximum protection
- **Predictable Response**: Consistent behavior under varying loads
- **System Stability**: No sudden state changes that could disrupt service

> _"In industrial systems, we learned that progressive control is more reliable than binary switches. The same principle revolutionizes cybersecurity."_

## ⚡ See It In Action

```bash
# Terminal output during an attack simulation
[2025-01-30 10:15:23] Detection: IP 192.168.1.100 - SSH failure count: 3/5
[2025-01-30 10:15:45] Throttling: IP 192.168.1.100 - Applying 2s delay
[2025-01-30 10:16:12] Detection: IP 192.168.1.100 - SSH failure count: 8/15
[2025-01-30 10:16:34] Throttling: IP 192.168.1.100 - Progressive delay: 5s
[2025-01-30 10:17:01] Blocking: IP 192.168.1.100 - Threat threshold exceeded, IP banned
[2025-01-30 10:17:02] Notification: Attack blocked, threat neutralized
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/sangwon0707/rotaryshield.git
cd rotaryshield

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install RotaryShield
sudo python setup.py install

# Install systemd service
sudo cp systemd/rotaryshield.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Start protecting immediately
sudo systemctl start rotaryshield
sudo systemctl enable rotaryshield

# Check status
sudo systemctl status rotaryshield
```

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
# Based on configs/config.example.yml
detection:
  log_files:
    - /var/log/auth.log      # SSH attempts
    - /var/log/nginx/access.log  # Web attempts
  patterns:
    ssh_fail: "Failed password.*from (\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)"
    web_fail: "HTTP/1\\.[01]\" [45]\\d\\d.*from (\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)"
  thresholds:
    warning: 3      # Enter throttling mode
    blocking: 10    # Full IP ban

throttling:
  ssh_delay: 2.0    # Seconds delay for SSH
  http_rate_limit: 5  # Requests per minute
  progressive: true   # Increase delay over time

blocking:
  ban_time: 3600    # 1 hour default ban
  firewall: "auto"  # auto-detect or specify: ufw/firewalld/iptables
  notification:
    email: true
    slack: false
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Monitor system logs
sudo journalctl -u rotaryshield -f

# View service status
sudo systemctl status rotaryshield

# Test configuration (Phase 1)
python -m rotaryshield.main --config-test

# Run in development mode
python src/rotaryshield/main.py --config configs/config.example.yml

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/
```

> **Note**: CLI commands (`rotaryshield monitor`, `list-blocked`, etc.) are planned for Phase 2 development.

## ⚠️ Phase 1 Status & Limitations

### Current Implementation Status
**RotaryShield Phase 1 is production-ready** with the following capabilities:

✅ **Working Features:**
- 3-layer security engine with full detection, throttling, and blocking
- Multi-platform firewall integration (ufw/firewalld/iptables)
- Real-time log monitoring with pattern matching  
- Enterprise SQLite database with IP management
- Complete security hardening and input validation
- systemd service integration with privilege separation

⚠️ **Phase 1 Limitations:**
- **No Web Dashboard**: Management via systemd/configuration files only
